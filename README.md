# *OUTDATED* DownloadCalcV4
## Maybe you need this:
### Install Golang you can find it here: https://go.dev/doc/install
### Install this repo https://github.com/ganeshdipdumbare/speedtest repo with this command `go install github.com/ganeshdipdumbare/speedtest@latest`
### I would recommend installing Golang `curl -sf https://gobinaries.com/ganeshdipdumbare/speedtest` command may not work well on windows!
###### It is Highly recommended to always install the newest version of DownloadCalc!
## For other OS
##### For Linux: https://github.com/NightSkyYT/DownloadCalcLinux/tree/master
