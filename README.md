## Stuff you need
You need to install Golang you can find it here: https://go.dev/doc/install
then you need to install this https://github.com/ganeshdipdumbare/speedtest repo with this command "go install github.com/ganeshdipdumbare/speedtest@latest"
I would highly recommend installing Golang bc for me this "curl -sf https://gobinaries.com/ganeshdipdumbare/speedtest | sh" command did not work on windows!
**I would Recommend you to ALWAYS download the Release files and not the files from the Code there never is 100% guarantee that this is the compiled version! the releases are Always compiled!**
